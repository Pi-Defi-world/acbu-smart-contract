//
// These shared types are used by the `acbu_multisig` contract and referenced
// by every contract that delegates admin authority to a multisig address.
//
// Design:
//   • A separate `MultisigContract` holds the signer list and threshold.
//   • Each protected contract stores the multisig contract address as its
//     "admin".  Admin-only functions call `admin.require_auth()` as before —
//     Soroban's auth tree propagates the M-of-N approval automatically when
//     the multisig contract is the invoker.
//   • The multisig contract exposes `propose` / `approve` / `execute` so that
//     M signers must independently authorise before any admin action fires.
